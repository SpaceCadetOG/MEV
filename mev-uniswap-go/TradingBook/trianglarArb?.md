## 1. What is arbitrage?

- Exchange A price of ETH = $1600
- Exchange B price of ETH = $1620
- if you buy on A and sell on B you will gain $20 profit
- Buy it some where and sell it for more
- Not risk-free...if the price dips before the sell, you can loss money
-   main risks in Triangular Arbitrage?
    - Calculation and Execution Risks = Trade to a illiquid pool or fees cut in profits

## 2. What is trianglar arbitrage?
    - 3 Pair => 3 asset x pair of 2each (trianglar group)
    - Same concept as before...but now can be on same market
    - Base / Quote (left/right)
    - Find the stronger asset and trade toward it

    EXAMPLE: {[A/B] = [B/C] = [A/C]}

    - Trade 1: => 10 a x 1.2 = 12 b

    - Trade 2: => 12b / (1.5c) = 8 c

    - Trade 3: => 8c / (0.5a) = 16 a

    - Profit: 16a - 10a = [6a]

    - 60% Gain!

### _You Must Understand!_

1. Establish the (1 / price) based on strength of a asset. Also the quoting structure
   - How each exchange quotes their prices
2. Where Bid/Ask is involved, always assume you get the worst price if in doubt
   - Where Is the path.
   - How to structure quotes
   - Always assume the exchange will take more money.
3. Each trianglar group should have two of each item

## Surface Rate vs Real Rate

- Surface rate => Face Value rate or a sticker price...price usually lower
- Real rate => Arbtratrage rate calcuklted after => capital amount and trading input
  - View the amount the exchange has and pretend trade to see the price impact
- Depth rate => Face Value rate or a sticker price...price usually lower
