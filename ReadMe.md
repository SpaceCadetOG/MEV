# MEV Research Post-Merge Repo

_This repo is all apart of my blockchain research for post merge. Ethereum will be used as a constant  compared W/ other Proof of Stake consensus models and how L2s like Arbtrium can help alivate. This repo will be updated through out the the 1 year post merge. We will be using arbtrium, zksync, starknet to evaluate ethereum's performance. I will also create strigies and compare them on all chains. We will test {Profits, Networks Latency, Solidity Coding Updates, amount of transactions based on money made}. This research is not intended to see which blockchain best. The Research will be transferable across EVM-Based chains. Findings on one chain will have some sort of relations to another one._

## Research Goals
1. Post-Merge 
    - *Capture Arbs using FIFO model*
        - Local Node Set Up vs Using Third Party
            - Is my local block faster than connecting
            - cost of doing it and scaling

    - *Relationships w/ Validator*
        - The increased # of them over 1 year since merge
            - Tier based on activity and particpation
        - ETH burned post EIP-1559, how that incentives the vaildator economics post-merge.
        -   Will it cause inflation? Will it dilute the system?

    - *Unstaking Period starts*
        - Will the network hold up with more transactions

    - *Does MEV make the network expensive to use*
        - If so how can you work around it 
        - Changes to propose in EIPs

    - *Maximize profits*
        - Time
            - Time of Day Most profit per trade
            - Time of Day trade happen most
            - Best time To trade

        - MEV Playbook
            - Short-tail
            - Long-Tail
            - Amount of Hops

2. [OEV => Oracle Extracted Value](https://medium.com/@nfett/on-oracle-extractable-value-f6c7a0d64af5)
  - *Getting Prices from OnChain Liquidity VS Chainlink Oracle*
  - *Can Chainlink Break All blockchains? Single Point of failure.*
    1. Why All protocols should create their own oracles based on liquity on platform
    2. Use Chainlink as a Fallback
- Oracle Manplation and Front-running
- Create TWAP oracle

3. MEV on L2
    - Arbtrum Has a mid state than Ethereum. How can that be exploited?
    - Who winning the race after 1 year
        - based on tech, user transactions, tvl

4. Will Protocols start to adopting MEV protection? 
    - If so that may require some fee.
    - Does that help or hurt the ecosystem?

5. 1Inch and Paraswap vs ME
