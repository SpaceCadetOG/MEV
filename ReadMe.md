# MEV Research Post-Merge Repo

_This repo is all apart of my blockchain research for post merge. W/ Proof of Stake consensus model and how L2s like Arbtrium can solve it. This repo will be updated through out the the 1 year post merge. We will be using arbtrium, avalanche, zksync, starknet to evaluate ethereum's performance. This isn't to see which is the best blockchain. The Research will be able transferable across EVM-Based chains_

## Research Goals
1. Post-Merge 
    - *Capture Arbs using FIFO model*
        - Local Node Set Up vs Using Third Party
            - Is my local block faster than connecting
            - cost of doing it and scaling

    - *Relationships w/ Validator*
        - The increased # of them over 1 year since merge
            - Tier based on activity and particpation
        - ETH burned post EIP-1559, how that incentives vaildators post-merge.
        -   Will it cause inflation? Will it dilute the system?

    - *Unstaking Period starts*
        - Will the network hold up with more transactions

    - *Does MEV make the network expensive to use*
        - If so how can you work around it 
        - Changes to propose in EIPs

    - *Maximize profits*
        - Time
            - Time of Day Most profit per trade
            - Time of Day trade happen most
            - Best time To trade

        - MEV Playbook
            - Short-tail
            - Long-Tail
            - Amount of Hops

2. [OEV => Oracle Extracted Value](https://medium.com/@nfett/on-oracle-extractable-value-f6c7a0d64af5)
  - *Getting Prices from OnChain Liquidity VS Chainlink Oracle*
  - *Can Chainlink Break All blockchains? Single Point of failure.*
    1. Why All protocols should create their own oracles based on liquity on platform
    2. Use Chainlink as a Fallback
- Oracle Manplation and Front-running

3. MEV on L2
    - Arbtrum Has a 4 block delay than Ethereum. How can that be exploited?
    - Who winning the race after 1 year
        - based on tech, user transactions, tvl

4. Will Protocols start to adopting MEV protection? 
    - If so that may require some fee.
    - Does that help or hurt the ecosystem?
