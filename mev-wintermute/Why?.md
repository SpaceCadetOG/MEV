# *Trading Crypto Like a Sport*

No seriously, george soros inspired me to do something similar in crypto...more so a profitable crafty trader. Pver this last 2 years in defi i have learned so much in finace that its humbled me. If you watch any of [Taiki Maeda videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheTaikster), he has a theory called the Humble Farmer Mindset. I will be applying that to MEV.  MEV is like the olympics of defi trading. I was a former 2 Sport Athletes so im gonna trade both DeFi and CeFi. Why...Cause i like to win. 

# Using Python, JavaScript, Go
- Basics of programming for all these languges
- will be easy to develop good best practices that will be translated on any platform and any script
- Also good for training and shapen the play book. If you want defi exclusive plays using solidity, look @ [my arbitrum playbook](https://github.com/SpaceCadetOG/MEV/tree/main/mev-arbitrum). Can be used on ETH but arbitrum is cheap and fast. But I will DEFI in Vyper!


Alot of what is here will be added to the other repos so you will see alot of overlap. Try to build a foundation of tools!
